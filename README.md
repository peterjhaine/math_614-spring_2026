# Math 614, Spring 2026: Mirror symmetry for toric varieties

## Course description
Let $X$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth projective toric variety over the complex numbers. 
In the 90s, Morelli [M] showed that there is injective homomorphism from the Grothendieck group of torus-equivariant vector bundles on $X$ into constructible functions $\mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{Z}$. 
Moreover, Morelli explicitly identified the image of this map. 
Around 2010, Fang–Liu–Treumann–Zaslow [FLTZ] proved the natural categorification of this: they provided a fully faithful embedding of torus-equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on $X$ into constructible sheaves on $\mathbf{R}^n$. 
Moreover, they explicitly identified the essential image of their embedding in terms of a microsupport condition. 

To goal of this course is to explain a proof the Fang–Liu–Treumann–Zaslow, however we will prove the result over the sphere spectrum. 
We'll use the path to this theorem as an opportunity to introduce a number of tools, starting with toric varieties and derived/spectral algebraic geometry, then moving on to tools more specific to the proof. 
Our exposition will follow a recent paper of Bai and Hu [BH]. 
In particular, we plan to explain how to deduce a nonequivariant version of the theorem (originally proved by Kuwagaki) from the equivariant one.

## Assignments/Grading

### Lecture notes
Shortly after every lecture, [below](#lecture-schedule--notes) I will post detailed handwritten notes for the lecture. The main work for this course will be to type up these notes in a class Overleaf/Git Repo. I'll likely edit them a bit after you type them.

I'll type the notes for the first two lectures. 
In the first week, we'll create a rotating schedule for typing up the notes. 
Here are the expectations:
+ You should finish typing the lecture notes by the lecture one week later. (So if you're typing up notes for Wednesday, 1/21, you should do so by Wednesday 1/28).
+ You should do a nice job of typing the notes, formatting them in a style consistent with the previous notes (using the first two lectures as an example), checking for typos, filling small gaps, and adding references when it makes sense.
+ Please try to format the LaTeX code nicely (using indentation and putting each sentence on a separate line). This makes editing easier.

### Final presentation
The second component of the course will be an in-class presentation on a topic related to the course, but outside of what we covered. It will be during the last weeks of class. More on this later.

### Grading scheme
50% typing up lecture notes + 50% final presentation.

## Lecture schedule & notes

+ [Overleaf for typed notes](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kpkwrssmtzrm#f9bb46) (viewable by anyone with the link)
+ [Git Repo for typed notes](https://github.com/peterjhaine/toric_mirror_symmetry_notes) (to get access, ask me)
+ Order that we'll cycle through for typing the notes (after the first two lectures): Baran, Jiayi, Michael, Yahya, Yash, Yijie.
