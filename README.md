# Math 614, Spring 2026: Mirror symmetry for toric varieties

## Course description
Let $X$ be an n-dimensional smooth projective toric variety over the complex numbers. 
In the 90s, Morelli showed that there is injective homomorphism from the Grothendieck group of torus-equivariant vector bundles on $X$ into constructible functions $\mathbf{R}^n \to \mathbf{Z}$. 
Moreover, Morelli explicitly identified the image of this map. 
Around 2010, Fang–Liu–Treumann–Zaslow proved the natural categorification of this: they provided a fully faithful embedding of torus-equivariant quasicoherent sheaves on $X$ into constructible sheaves on $\mathbf{R}^n$. 
Moreover, they explicitly identified the essential image of their embedding in terms of a microsupport condition. 

To goal of this course is to explain a proof the Fang–Liu–Treumann–Zaslow, however we will prove the result over the sphere spectrum. 
We'll use the path to this theorem as an opportunity to introduce a number of tools, starting with toric varieties and derived/spectral algebraic geometry, then moving on to tools more specific to the proof. 
Our exposition will follow a recent paper of Bai and Hu. 
In particular, we plan to explain how to deduce a nonequivariant version of the theorem (originally proved by Kuwagaki) from the equivariant one.

## Assignments/Grading

### Lecture notes
Shortly after every lecture, I will post detailed handwritten notes for the lecture. The main work for this course will be to type up these notes in a class Overleaf/Git Repo. I'll likely edit them a bit after you type them.

I'll type the notes for the first two lectures. 
In the first week, we'll create a rotating schedule for typing up the notes. 
Here are the expectations:
+ You should finish typing the lecture notes by the lecture one week later. (So if you're typing up notes for Wednesday, 1/21, you should do so by Wednesday 1/28).
+ You should do a nice job of typing the notes, formatting them in a style consistent with the previous notes (using the first two lectures as an example), checking for typos, filling small gaps, and adding references when it makes sense. 

### Final presentation
The second component of the course will be an in-class presentation during the last weeks of the semester.

### Grading scheme
50% typing up lecture notes + 50% final presentation.
